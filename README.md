# R.G.BEAT

Submission for the Amaze Me GMS2 Jam

Rhythm based top-down shooter

Source code and documentation are primarily in .gml files under Neon>src>Neon>objects

For example, most documentation for the player object is located in [Neon>src>Neon>objects>obj_player>Step_0.gml](https://github.com/Om-Abb/Neon/blob/main/src/Neon/objects/obj_player/Step_0.gml)

Check out the final project on [itch.io!](https://abbas-io.itch.io/rgbeat)
